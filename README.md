# PersoChecker
This is a bot that checks if my Personalausweis is ready to get picked up at the Bürgerbüro in Munich. It will (hopefully) get notfied by an Email.

current Status of my Personalausweis:
[![Do i need to wait longer?](https://github.com/echtlersebastian/PersoChecker/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/echtlersebastian/PersoChecker/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

(Green means, that i need to wait longer. As soon, as it turns red, i will be able to create an appointment and pick up my new Personalausweis!)

# What it does:
 - Selenium Test opening the Website muenchen.de/pass and entering my Abholcode.
 - Checks if the status is "kann noch nicht abgeholt werden". 
 - If yes, the test is green. 
 - If no, the Status has changed and i will get an Email about the failed Test.
 
# How it runs:
 - Github Action running on a scedule builds and executes the NUnit Tests. 
 
# How to use:
 - fork the Repo, change the Abholnummer to your Abholnummer and create a Github Action (just copy my dotnet.yml File in the Workflow folder and you are good to go). :)
 
 Have fun waiting on your new Perso!
